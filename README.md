# Kerdos — Heads-Up Limit Hold’em with NFSP (RLCard + PyTorch)

*Kerdos* is a self-contained reinforcement-learning project that trains a **Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP)** agent on heads-up limit Texas Hold’em using the [RLCard 1.2.0] framework and PyTorch 2.6. You can

* train the NFSP agent from scratch  
* measure win-rate versus baseline opponents  
* play interactively against the trained model in a terminal UI

Everything runs on macOS (Apple Silicon **or** Intel) inside a Python virtual environment.
